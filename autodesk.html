                    <p class="subtitle-text">Stakeholder Interviews</p>
                    <p>We began by conducting video interviews with several members of Autodesk's
                        team -- including our two primary contacts, a Senior Learning Content
                        Developer and an Experience Design Architect -- who were concerned with our
                        target product. These preliminary interviews enabled us to properly gauge
                        our scope in terms of what elements of Revit LT's learning and onboarding
                        system we were to focus on: tutorials, essential skills videos, and sample
                        models.</p>
                    <p>Our contacts emphasized their particular interest in the effectiveness of the
                        program's videos and tutorials, but were also open to other critiques that
                        may be valuable for the system.</p>

                    <p>
                        We first began with a high-level overview of the Revit LT software and its
                        related documentation, then generated
                        a static representation of the relevant structures in the form of an
                        interaction map.

                    <p class="subtitle-text">User Interviews</p>
<p>
    The next phase saw our team conducting semi-structured interviews with a
    selected group of participants who
    possessed varying levels of experience in computer-aided design in the field
    of architecture. In total, we
    conducted five interviews with each lasting around 30-60 minutes.
</p>
<p> We determined the main user group on which to focus included both
    professional and student architects at
    beginner and intermediate levels. From our interivews and research, we
    created diffrent three personas to
    represent our potential user types. </p>
<p>Below is an example of one persona: Sara Ji, a third-year master's student in
    architecture. Other personas
    included an undergraduate architecture student and a professional architect.

<div id="compeval">
    <p class="subtitle-text">Comparative Analysis</p>
    <p>We then researched and evaluated five competitor products in order to compare
        the online learning materials and
        processes that each software offered. This culminated in a matrix that
        highlighted various strenths and
        weaknesses of the different programs (with a focus on their videos and
        tutorials) as well as as series of
        preliminary findings and recommendations.</p>

    <p class="subtitle-text">Heuristic Evaluations</p>
    <p>Next, we utilized heuristic evaluation methods, based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 principles of interaction design, to assess the information structure of the Revit documentation site.</p></div>

    <div><img data-src="images/autodesk/nielsenArtboard 2 copy 9@2x-1.png"></div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>After we individually recorded the results of the evaluation as written
        reports, we made a spreadsheet which
        includes heuristic numbers and findings in each criteria with comments and
        severity ratings on a numerical scale
        of 1-5. Once each comment was rated, we aggregated the findings that had the
        highest rates.</p>
</div> <!-- closes hevals-->

<div id='surveys'>
    <p class="subtitle-text">Surveys</p>
    <p>For our surveys, we sought data from both professional and student architects
        regarding demographic details about
        users, their opinions on Revit’s help documentation and onboarding
        materials, and also more general preferences
        regarding methods of online learning.</p>
    <p>Our survey was live for 10 days and received 63 responses.</p>

<div id="preftests">
    <p class="subtitle-text">Preference Testing</p>
    <p>Next, preference tests were conducted out in order assess user reactions to
        changes made with these evaluations
        in mind. Selected users were asked for their preferences and opinions about
        current implementations and their
        mocked-up prototype
        counterparts.

    <p>Finally, we conducted five usability tests for the current software and
        documentation site. Our goal was to
        evaluate if users could successfully and efficiently navigate to the
        documentation they need from inside the
        software, as well as around the website it lives on. We gave each user four
        tasks to complete.
    <p>Throughout the
        duration of the testing, our members observed, moderated, and data logged
        for the participants (example
        below). Each individual test lasted from 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

<div id="findings">
    <p class="subtitle-text">Findings & Recommendations</p>
    <p>The following are brief summaries of our findings and recommendations for
        Revit LT & Autodesk, synthesized from
        our research conducted over the course of the semester. </p><br>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Regardless of users’ experience with Revit or RLT, the search
            functionality was utilized more than organic
            browsing through the sidebar navigation.</li>
        <li>Users preferred a walkthrough-style approach to tutorial materials.</li>
        <li>Users often overlooked the provided help documentation within RLT.</li>
        <li>Usability tests showed users of varying experience had mixed opinions
            about the suggested workflows and
            documentation examples.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Redesign the help site to place a focus on searching as the first
            action, rather than clicking through
            thumbnails or
            navigation links.</li>
        <li>Make it more apparent within the software how users can learn more about
            using RLT.</li>
        <li>Examples used to explain the <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> of the workflows
            should always be relevant and focused
            on the work that users will be conducting</li>
    </ol>
