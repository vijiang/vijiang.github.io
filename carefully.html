                    <h2>Background Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (also known as self-harm, self-mutilation, or self-abuse) is the act of intentionally causing injury to one’s body, but often without suicidal intent. Common methods include skin cutting, burning, and punching or bruising of the body; however, there are a myriad of ways in which people inflict damage on themselves and many individuals hurt themselves in more than one way <a href="https://www.mhanational.org/conditions/self-injury-cutting-self-harm-or-self-mutilation" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to explore alternative behaviours to self-injury in times of intense emotional stress. Because people frequently engage with NSSI in order to find relief from their immediate situation, I sought a solution that focused on providing immediately actionable alternatives rooted in healthier, less harmful coping mechanisms and more
                        long-term emotional care and management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The primary audience is composed of adolescents and young adults; however, due to the prevalence of self-injury in populations outside this grouping (primarily in adults, but in some younger children as well), any potential alternatives and solutions will, hopefully, also address characteristics unique to these audiences.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Design Features</h2>
                    <h3>Create a safety net</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based on a feature implemented in <a href="https://www.clearfear.co.uk/" target="_blank">Clear Fear</a> and also commonly referred to as a “Personal Safety Plan,” the safety net feature is based off <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Brown_StanleySafetyPlanTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">existing templates</a> designed to immediately assist a user in coping with suicidal or self-harm ideations. The form is not a pre-provided list of actions; rather, the user fills it out themselves with their best outcomes in mind.</p>
                        <p>The inclusion of this function also connects to two common Behavioural Change Techniques (BCTs) as described by <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/192b/2b4df2b7fbf4c09b95d1709ded69de3c07b2.pdf" target="_blank">Abraham and Michie</a>: planning social support or change and agreeing on a behavioural contract.</p>

                        <h3>Fade the urge</h3>
                        <p>This feature offers three subfeatures: following a breathing exercise, writing a brief journal entry documenting the user’s current feelings, and choosing from several tasks that could offer distractions from the immediate thought cycle.</p>
                        <p>
                        One of the graphic design features used on this page invoke the idea of “waves” which comes from Dr. Krause’s work. Her application, <a href="https://calmharm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Calm Harm</a>, related the urge to self-harm to be one similar to a wave; the best way to overcome it is to ride it out.</p>

                    <h3>Go to my journal</h3>
                    <p>A space for users to view previous journal entries and urge recordings, or to add new entries for both. In recording an urge, a user indicates the “strength” or intensity of the urge based on a sliding scale (with discrete values). </p>
