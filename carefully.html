                <p>Carefully is a mobile application designed to assist users with managing self-harm. It provides the following three services:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Create, edit, or view their safety net:</b> a collection of methods
                        to help themselves and friends or family who can help them.</li>
                    <li><b>Fade the urge:</b> a handful of tasks such as breathing exercises
                        that may help to calm the user</li>
                    <li><b>Track feelings and urges:</b>a log of brief journal entries and
                        recordings of urges to assist the user in monitoring their behaviours
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </div>

                    <p>Behavioural Change Techniques (BCTs) (as described by Abraham and Michie in <a
                    href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/192b/2b4df2b7fbf4c09b95d1709ded69de3c07b2.pdf"
                    target="_blank">their 2008 paper</a>) were the foundation of the
                    application's main features. I chose several types of common behavioural
                    interventions and mapped out causal pathways showing how anticipated proximal
                    outcomes (small, measurable changes in behaviour as a result of a BCT) could
                    lead to a desired distal outcome.</p></div>

                    <div>
                    <p>
                        From this, I played around with which pathways could be integrated with one
                        other, and which should stand alone. The three main features of this
                        application arose from translating these conceptual pathways into something
                        usable.

                    <p class="center-text">Create a Safety net</p>
                    <p>Based on a feature implemented in <a href="https://www.clearfear.co.uk/"
                        target="_blank">Clear Fear</a> and also commonly referred to as a “Personal
                    Safety Plan,” the safety net feature is based off <a
                        href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Brown_StanleySafetyPlanTemplate.pdf"
                        target="_blank">existing templates</a> designed to immediately assist a user
                    in coping with suicidal or self-harm ideations. The form is not a pre-provided
                    list of actions; rather, the user fills it out themselves with their best
                    outcomes in mind.</p>
                    <p>The inclusion of this function also connects to two common BCTs such as
                        planning social support or change and agreeing on a behavioural contract.</p>

                    <p class="center-text">Fade the Urge</p>
                    <p>This feature offers three subfeatures: following a breathing exercise,
                    writing a brief journal entry documenting the user’s current feelings, and
                    choosing from several tasks that could offer distractions from the immediate
                    thought cycle.</p>
                    <p>
                    One of the graphic design features used on this page invoke the idea of
                    “waves” which comes from Dr. Krause’s work. Her application, <a
                    href="https://calmharm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Calm Harm</a>, related
                    the urge to self-harm to be one similar to a wave; the best way to overcome
                    it is to ride it out.</p>

                    <p>A space for users to view previous journal entries and urge recordings, or to
                    add new entries for both. In recording an urge, a user indicates the
                    “strength” or intensity of the urge based on a sliding scale (with discrete
                    values). </p>
