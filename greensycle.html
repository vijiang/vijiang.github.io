                    <p>With this design project, my goal was to address the problems from incorrect
                    recycling practices that can arise when the information and regulations of Ann
                    Arbor’s curbside recycling program are not well known. I hope to better inform
                    residents of what can and cannot be recycled, and to also suggest means for the
                    collective recycling of items that are not able to be placed in convenient
                    curbside bins (such as plastic bags, thermal papers, and certain types of
                    packing
                    materials).</p>

                            article</a> for the New York Times, Livia Albeck-Ripka describes a
                        behavior that waste managers have begun to call wishful or "aspirational
                        recycling," which occurs when "we want something to be recyclable, so we put
                        it in the recycling bin." This unintentional sabotage of recycling
                        initiatives is quite detrimental, as contaminated or impure batches of
                        recycled materials are often rejected by buyers and sent to the landfill
                        instead.

                        <b>GreenSycle</b> is an Ann Arbor-specific mobile app that serves as a
                        direct connection to ​Recycle Ann Arbor.​ The application makes it fast and
                        easy to search up proper methods of recycling (curbside, drop-off, etc.) in
                        order to cut down on contaminated batches of recycled material. It is a
                        simple, powerful, and informative way to find out how best to
                        manage what you want to - or think you can - recycle in your daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aspirational recyclers will be able to find basic information on how to
                        properly dispose of materials they are unsure of, based on local standards.
                        The application will also provide details on why the acceptable method is
                        the way it is, and what alternatives to recycling are available for that
                        specific material or it (i.e., reusing glass jars as
                        decorative vases or canning jars).

                        <i>Text & Image Search:</i>
                    <p>The user will be taken to a result page that displays the name of the
                        material/object and any other identifying specifics; it also indicates
                        whether or not the item is curbside recyclable via colour (green vs. red)
                        and text. The emphasis on curbside recyclability was chosen because of its
                        popularity of use amongst residents of Ann Arbor, as well as at the
                        University of Michigan, in which many buildings provide recycling and trash
                        bins in the hallways. </p>
                    
                    <p><i>Calendars & Events:</i></p>
                    
                    <p>Users have access to an in-app calendar feature that allows for reminders to
                        be set for trash/recycling collection days. Additionally, upcoming events
                        such as community drop-offs to the recycling center, or neighborhood
                        environmental activities (loosely related to the application), can also be
                        displayed.</p>
                    
                    <p><i>Neighborhood:</i></p>
                    
                    <p>The application’s distinguishing feature can be accessed inside the main
                        menu. From the map that opens, users can view their current location, as
                        well as the relative locations of other Ann Arbor residents who are using
                        the app. By clicking on the dropped points on the nap, the user can create
                        their own neighborhood events (such as drop-offs), or check if any of their
                        neighbors are planning something for the future. </p>
