                        With this design project, my goal was to address the problems and incorrect recycling practices that can arise when the information and regulations of Ann Arbor’s curbside recycling program are not well known. I hope to better inform residents of what can and cannot be recycled, and to also suggest means for the collective recycling of items that are not able to be placed in convenient curbside bins (such as plastic bags, thermal papers, and certain types of packing
                        materials).

                                In a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html">recent article</a> for the New York Times, Livia Albeck-Ripka describes a behavior that waste managers have begun to call wishful or "aspirational recycling," which occurs when "we want something to be recyclable, so we put it in the recycling bin." This unintentional sabotage of recycling initiatives is quite detrimental, as contaminated or impure batches of recycled materials are often rejected by buyers and sent to the landfill instead.

                                and helped me narrow my scope and purpose.

                                    <b>GreenSycle</b> is an Ann Arbor-specific mobile app that serves as a direct connection to ​Recycle Ann Arbor.​ The application makes it fast and easy to search up proper methods of recycling (curbside, drop-off, etc.) in order to cut down on contaminated batches of recycled material. It is a simple, powerful, and informative way to find out how best to
                                    manage what you want to - or think you can - recycle in your daily life.

The application will also provide details on why the acceptable method is the way it is, and what alternatives to recycling are available for that specific material or it (i.e., reusing glass jars as
                                    decorative vases or canning jars).
