                    <p>As part of our User Experience Master Course, my team and I were tasked with
                        developing a semester-long design project in the form of an interactive
                        museum exhibit that intervened with a contemporary social, political, and/or
                        economic issue.</p>
                    <p>Our initial set of ideas revolved around producing creative sensory
                        experiences with inputs from visitors. We then conducted design research for
                        audience and context in order to help us narrow our vision.</p>
                    <p><b>Comparative Analysis</b></p>
                    <p>In order to gain an understanding of the current museum landscape, my team
                        and I looked at three categories of museums (art, natural history, and
                        speciality) with a focus on their exhibit offerings, visitation patterns and
                        reviews, and any common themes and practices that would contribute to our
                        understanding of exhibit purposes and appeal. </p>
                    <p><b>Interviews</b></p>
                    <p>Three rounds of interviews were conducted for contextual inquiry, expert
                        opinions, and general feedback and critique from our peers. We talked to
                        recent museum visitors, museum staff, professors in the departments of
                        Psychology and Information.</p>
                    <p><b>Brainstorming Sessions</b></p>
                    <p>At our meetings, we analysed data from our design research and used our
                        findings to open up discussion and to brainstorm and develop new concepts
                        for our exhibit. We designed user story maps to fine-tune and visualize
                        potential ideas we wanted to move forward with.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="subtitle-text"><u>Key Findings</u></p>
                    <img data-src="images/table/key_findings.png" alt="Key findings">
                    <p>Using the feedback we were provided, we began to discuss how our senses have
                        an impact on our experiences within our own cultures, largely through
                        festive meals and other holiday celebrations. We felt that this idea could
                        cohesively tie together our sensory explorations.</p>
                    <p>
                        Honing in on this theme lent our exhibit more of a personal touch by
                        studying our personal "hyphenated" identities. Within our group, we have
                        representations of Taiwanese-American, Chinese-American, Indian-American,
                        and Jewish-American. Questions we wanted to explore included: which “side”
                        of the hyphen did we belong to? Or on what basis should we view our
                        identities as hyphenated in the first place? We were interested in
                        contextualizing our at-home lives, rituals, and languages with museum
                        visitors on a more personal level.</p>
                    <p>
                        From there, we based our exhibit around festive meals in our hyphenated
                        cultures that would allow the chance to tell our personal stories of what it
                        is like, as well as having the opportunity for visitors to participate.</p>

                        <p>Taking inspiration from a Japanese tea ceremony table (created by <a
                                href="https://www.tellart.com/projects/asian-galleries/"
                                target="_blank">Tellart</a>) at the Detroit Institute of Art, our
                            final design consisted of an interactive table with a touchscreen that
                            triggered an experience based on the placement of a specific physical
                            object, symbolic of a specific holiday as chosen by the user.</p>
                </div>
                <div><img data-src="images/table/design-strybrd.png">
                </div>
            <div>
                <p>Pictured above: Sketching out a (preliminary) storyboard for the user's
                    overall exhibit experience, from finding the room to sitting down &
                    experiencing it. One of several iterations.</p>
                <p>Our prototype explored three holidays (Lunar New Year, Passover, and
                    Christmas) as our families would celebrate them at our homes in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>This experience was auditory and visual in nature: users could tap a dish or
                    item depicted on the table to find out <i>our</i> thoughts about it, or to
                    hear quiet discussions about its place in our life and/or its cultural
                    meanings. A QR code leads to an online recipe for the dish, if applicable.
