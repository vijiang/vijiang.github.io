My team (Corzetti Labs) worked to provide feedback on how to best improve the learning experience for new software users. In order to do so, we stepped through various elements of the usability testing process, including:

                        <br>
                        <p>We began by conducting video interviews with several members of Autodesk's team -- including our two primary contacts, a Senior Learning Content Developer and an Experience Design Architect -- who were concerned with our target product. These preliminary interviews enabled us to properly gauge our scope in terms of what elements of Revit LT's learning and onboarding system we were to focus on: tutorials, essential skills videos, and sample models. 
                        <p>Our contacts emphasized their particular interest in the effectiveness of the program's videos and tutorials, but were also open to other critiques that may be valuable for the system.</p></p>

                            We first began with a high-level overview of the Revit LT software and its related documentation, then generated a static representation of the relevant structures in the form of an interaction map.

                            The next phase saw our team conducting semi-structured interviews with a selected group of participants who possessed varying levels of experience in computer-aided design in the field of architecture. In total, we conducted five interviews with each lasting around 30-60 minutes. 
                        </p>
                        <p> We determined the main user group on which to focus included both professional and student architects at beginner and intermediate levels. From our interivews and research, we created diffrent three personas to represent our potential user types. </p>
                        <p>Below is an example of one persona: Sara Ji, a third-year master's student in architecture. Other personas included an undergraduate architecture student and a professional architect. </p>

This culminated in a matrix that highlighted various strenths and weaknesses of the different programs (with a focus on their videos and tutorials) as well as as series of preliminary findings and recommendations.</p>

                        <p>Next, we utilized heuristic evaluation methods, based on Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 principles of interaction design, to assess the information structure of the Revit documentation site.</p>
                        <p>After we individually recorded the results of the evaluation as written reports, we made a spreadsheet which includes heuristic numbers and findings in each criteria with comments and severity ratings on a numerical scale of 1-5. Once each comment was rated, we aggregated the findings that had the highest rates.</p>

                        <p>Our survey was live for 10 days and received 63 responses.</p>

                        <h3>Findings</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Regardless of usersâ€™ experience with Revit or RLT, the search functionality was utilized more than organic browsing through the sidebar navigation.</li>
                            <li>Users preferred a walkthrough-style approach to tutorial materials.</li>
                            <li>Users often overlooked the provided help documentation within RLT.</li>
                            <li>Usability tests showed users of varying experience had mixed opinions about the suggested workflows and documentation examples.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Redesign the help site to place a focus on searching as the first action, rather than clicking through thumbnails or
                            navigation links.</li>
                            <li>Make it more apparent within the software how users can learn more about using RLT.</li>
                            <li>Examples used to explain the <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> of the workflows should always be relevant and focused on the work that users will be conducting</li>
                        </ol>
