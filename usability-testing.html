                    <br>
                    <p>We began by conducting video interviews with several members of Autodesk's team -- including our two primary contacts, a Senior Learning Content Developer and an Experience Design Architect -- who were concerned with our target product. These preliminary interviews enabled us to properly gauge our scope in terms of what elements of Revit LT's learning and onboarding system we were to focus on: tutorials, essential skills videos, and sample models.</p>
                    <p>Our contacts emphasized their particular interest in the effectiveness of the program's videos and tutorials, but were also open to other critiques that may be valuable for the system.</p>

                    <p>
                        We first began with a high-level overview of the Revit LT software and its related documentation, then generated
                        a static representation of the relevant structures in the form of an interaction map.

                        The next phase saw our team conducting semi-structured interviews with a selected group of participants who
                        possessed varying levels of experience in computer-aided design in the field of architecture. In total, we
                        conducted five interviews with each lasting around 30-60 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p> We determined the main user group on which to focus included both professional and student architects at
                        beginner and intermediate levels. From our interivews and research, we created diffrent three personas to
                        represent our potential user types. </p>
                    <p>Below is an example of one persona: Sara Ji, a third-year master's student in architecture. Other personas
                        included an undergraduate architecture student and a professional architect. </p>

                    <p>We then researched and evaluated five competitor products in order to compare the online learning materials and
                        processes that each software offered. This culminated in a matrix that highlighted various strenths and
                        weaknesses of the different programs (with a focus on their videos and tutorials) as well as as series of
                        preliminary findings and recommendations.</p>

                    <p>Next, we utilized heuristic evaluation methods, based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 principles of interaction design, to
                        assess the information structure of the Revit documentation site.</p>
                    <p>After we individually recorded the results of the evaluation as written reports, we made a spreadsheet which
                        includes heuristic numbers and findings in each criteria with comments and severity ratings on a numerical scale
                        of 1-5. Once each comment was rated, we aggregated the findings that had the highest rates.</p>

                        users, their opinions on Revit’s help documentation and onboarding materials, and also more general preferences
                        regarding methods of online learning.</p>

                        in mind. Selected users were asked for their preferences and opinions about current implementations and their

                        evaluate if users could successfully and efficiently navigate to the documentation they need from inside the
                        software, as well as around the website it lives on. We gave each user four tasks to complete. <p>Throughout the
                            duration of the testing, our members observed, moderated, and data logged for the participants (example
                            below). Each individual test lasted from 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

                    <p>The following are brief summaries of our findings and recommendations for Revit LT & Autodesk, synthesized from
                        our research conducted over the course of the semester. </p><br>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Regardless of users’ experience with Revit or RLT, the search functionality was utilized more than organic
                            browsing through the sidebar navigation.</li>
                        <li>Users preferred a walkthrough-style approach to tutorial materials.</li>
                        <li>Users often overlooked the provided help documentation within RLT.</li>
                        <li>Usability tests showed users of varying experience had mixed opinions about the suggested workflows and
                            documentation examples.</li>

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Redesign the help site to place a focus on searching as the first action, rather than clicking through
                            thumbnails or
                            navigation links.</li>
                        <li>Make it more apparent within the software how users can learn more about using RLT.</li>
                        <li>Examples used to explain the <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> of the workflows should always be relevant and focused
                            on the work that users will be conducting</li>
